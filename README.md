# DarkerShiny

## Description

An out-of-the-box Shiny app template that we'll use to walk through the hypothetical example of a cybersecurity company. The components are:

- Shiny web app framework  
- `ggplot2` visualization toolkit  
- `maps` package for geo-visualization tool  
- `dplyr` and other members of the `tidyverse` family  
- [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- HTML and CSS  

## Installation and Usage

#### Method 1: Fork to your own repo (Recommended)
1. Forking it and then using `git clone`.  
- Example: `git clone https://github.com/onlyphantom/darkershiny.git`
2. Run `app.R`

#### Method 2: Download and Run
1. Download the repo from [this repo](https://github.com/onlyphantom/darkershiny). 
2. Run `app.R`

The dependencies are automatically installed if R doesn't detect them. After installation, it is recommended that you stay connected to the internet while running `app.R` for the first time. R packages are installed on your computer so you will not need to have an active internet connection after this. 

## Workshop
The code and its asset can be used to follow along the code-along session of Algoritma's Kickstart Series: Gentle introduction to Developing Web Apps in R & Python.

In this workshop, he will walk us through his favorite tools, workflow, and productivity tips:

- Recommendations on productionizing R code  
- The Shiny framework for data scientists  
- Using Python's web frameworks for application development  
- TensorFlow as a web service  
- Cloud deployment options for R- or Python-based applications  
- Production concerns: security, uptime, and continuous integration  
- Productivity tools for real-life data science: Git, IDE extensions, Virtual Environments vs Docker
